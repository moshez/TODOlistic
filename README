Overview
========
TODOlistic is a web-app to read e-mail as though it was a TODO list.

It snarfs the e-mail through IMAP or POP3 and puts it in a Maildir.
It then classifies the e-mail into one of five types:
1. TODO -- a thing that needs to be done
2. Notification -- a notification
3. Discussion
4. Content -- a file attachment with a header
5. Spam

Classification, in metadata, is kept in a rolling-file as described in
http://moshez.wordpress.com/2008/02/07/keeping-changing-configuration-data/

The user can override any of those things to reclassify a piece of e-mail.
The system learns from the evidence of the user reclassifying.
TODO: Think about where to keep the evidence.

The web-app is composed of:
* Dashboard
** Shows summary of everything else
* TODO
** Shows TODO items, ordered in "magic order" (priority+due-date)
** Allows adding comments to TODO items, adding TODO items, marking them as done, etc.
* Discussion
** UI inspired on Facebook -- original message that started the thread, then things beneath it.
** UI tries to guess whether to full-collapse, full-show or show-last-two
* Content
** Shows all files, with annotations on their contents
** Allows searching
* Spam
** Mostly for reclassifying into something else.

Architecture:
"Assume AJAX":
* Twisted with:
** RESTful interface for retrieval
** REST/JSON-RPC for setting stuff
* HTML with Javascript for UI
